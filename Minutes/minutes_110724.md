## Bad UI Assignment
[15 Bad UI Mistakes](https://synodus.com/blog/web-development/bad-ui-design/)
* Bad UI design has nothing to do with beauty or aesthetics. People use elements to navigate and understand how it works, so it is best the simpler and more practical the program is; the more enhanced your experience will get. There are multiple signs of bad UI designs, they are as follows: Slow and clunky interaction, complicated (difficult to understand), confusion (visitor is unsure of where to go next), inconsistent design, no clear target audience for the website, lack of social interaction, issues with readability. Some examples include there are no differences between primary and secondary buttons, no use of text hierarchy, bad icons or image contrast, and poor touch buttons.

[7 Bad UI Examples](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/bad-ui-design-examples)
* When designing good software UI, there are many factors to consider. It is important to test for edge cases such as overflowing text or overlapping UI components. It is also important to arrange components in an intuitive and efficient manner. One should also consider the spectrum of different devices that may be used to access the software such as mobile phones or laptops with smaller screens. It is also important to design software with color theory considered for factors such as complementary colors to ensure good visibility without putting excess strain on user's eyes.

[How to Fix A Bad UI](https://www.scotthurff.com/posts/why-your-user-interface-is-awkward-youre-ignoring-the-ui-stack/) 
* When creating a functioning UI, you need to make sure the user knows when something went wrong in the application. An example of this would be playing a video game with a loading screen but there are no visible loading bars or animations to indicate that the game is successfully loading or has stopped and encountered an error. 

Applications need 5 states:
- Ideal State (point at which your application is at its best and what you want the user to experience)
- Empty State (initial opening of the application. The fresh non-personalized version everyone interacts with)
- Error State (screen for when things go wrong. application shouldn't undo or destroy user information)
- Partial State (state during inbetween empty and ideal states. usually there to not seem empty but to help users see the end goal. tasks/completion bars)
- Loading State (point when loading occurs. connecting to servers, downloading data, etc. provide interactive displays during loading states so you don't have to experience half-loaded pages inbetween loading)

## Action Items
