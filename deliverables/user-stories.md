# Team Undergrad User-Stories
---
## Overview:
- The game should allow for the user to play checkers against a bot with varying difficulties and be able to click and move pieces on an interactive board with savable settings.
### User-Stories
- As a user, a menu with different options is prompted and gives me multiple choices to make. I can adjust the appearance of my layout screen and how difficult my opponent can be. 
- As a player, I want to sign into my account, decide an opponent's difficulty, so that I can start a game where I will be able to move the pieces and have an opponent react with my progress being saved until and after the game concludes. 
- As a user, I would want a checkers game with the option to leave your game at any given stage and, but this is not the most tedious part, it is not having the option to move the pieces backwards besides just moving them in the front and exposing them against the user. 
### Developer stories
- As a front-end developer, I want an interface with interactive mechanics so that other users can click and interact with. So, the player will be able to reach the board with a single button. And be able to apply certain settings to the board. 
- As a back-end developer for the Checkers GUI as well as the backend for the AI/bot functionality, I want to design a GUI that will be able to send and receive data from the game mechanics back-end so that the board reacts and functions properly with user input clicks so that the board can highlight to indicate available moves after a piece has been selected.  
- As a back-end developer I want to send and receive data from the front-end so that I can determine the bot difficulty and user-clicks so that I can create a functioning bot that makes moves based on user-selected difficulty. 
- As a developer, we will be tackling this issue by adding a database which will gather the users name and save their game to the current move and when the player wants to reopen their saved game. To tackle the moving backward request, we will be adding into the game mechanics the option to either move front or backwards and give the players a highlighted path of all the legal moves.
