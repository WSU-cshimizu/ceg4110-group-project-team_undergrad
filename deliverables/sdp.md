# Software Development Plan

### Communication Plan
* **Administrative**
    - *Meeting Locations* (Decided Weekly)
        - Library
        - Computer Lab in Russ
        - Student Union
        - Russ Lobby
        - Virtual (Discord)
    - *Meeting Times*
        - Every Thursday 12:20~1:20pm 
    - *Communicating Plan* (Meeting Structure & Cadence)
        - Spend time opening a progress report on oneâ€™s current work.
            - In-person and for virtual meetings. 
        - Justification for communication plan - We decided to meet both in-person and have virtual meeting to make it easier if one of the team members miss a meeting.
    - *Project Management*
        - Excel (Gannt chart), word doc and markdown on GitHub
            - Organize thoughts, schedule timings and work progress.
    - *PM Justification*
        - Interface GUI was given two weeks for the purpose of giving enough time to find a proper GUI and implement it. Libraries were also looked at to properly determine which GUI interface was suitable.
        - Interface menu was only given one week because it was deemed to be not too difficult. It goes off as an extension of the GUI as it is mainly getting buttons onto the screen.
        - Interface bot was only given one week because we believe that only a difficulty bot selection is needed here and it does not appear too difficult currently.
        - Board/GUI: Two weeks was given for this as the first week was used to research Java GUI libraries and software platforms before creating that would coincide with the settings GUI also being worked on during this timeframe. The second week was used designing and creating the Checkers GUI.
        - AI/Bot: Two weeks were given for this as the first week will be used to begin work and determine if the two week justification will be adequate by the deadline. 

- **SDLC Details**
    - *Scrum*
        - When using scrum, we are actively assigning tasks to one another. Setting deadlines, progress and completion dates.

### Timeline
- **MVSs** (Minimal viable specification)
    - Game Board GUI
    - Moveable/Functional Game Pieces
- **Milestones** (Check-Ins)
    - End of the Week (Thursday 12:20~1:20pm)
    - 10/03: Board/GUI deadline was set because as a main top level component, its existence helps us test and continue production for the backend of the checkers game mechanics.
    - 10/17: AI/Bot deadline was set for this date as it's components function off of the game mechanics and require the game mechanic backend to function properly. 
- **Requirement Specification**
    - Allow user to move pieces on a clickable GUI
- **Design Specification**
    - Java-designed game with multiple classes working together to complete functionality.
