## Pertinent Questions
* Question 1
    - Does Riversideâ€™s internal AI learn from new internal input? Is the data stored somewhere? Is this a security risk? 

* Question 2
    - During rapid development, since the goal is to get something working out fast for feedback, how are software tests done? Are they done in each increment of assignment along with a task? Or are they all last checked near the end?

## Lessons Learned

Make quick prototype to better get feedback sooner and get rolling.

Things are considered valuable if they are useful, useable, and used.

### Differences: 

- Results driven 

- Work on customer problem 

- Utilize quick prototyping and later utilize agile work 

- Work quickly to get an adoption 

- Instead of minimum viable product he referred to it as minimum usable product. Implying more emphasis on the end-user's use of the product and determining what they want.
