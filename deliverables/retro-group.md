# Group Retrospective

## What went well in the group...
* Being able to communicate at certain points in the project to integrate each other's code.
* We were able to overcome scheduling hurdles and task redistributions with the unforseen class-drop from one of our team members early on.
* Diversifying skill sets with some members focusing on GUI aspects and practicing JavaFX and others workiong on backend programming.

## What could have been better in the group...
* Distrubution of the work and estimation of difficulty for certain components.
* Some parts of the early task management seemed to overlap in some respects so responsibilities conflicted at times.
* Better and more generous scheduling for various tasks.

## What went well in the class...
* Lots of in-class work time to collaborate with group members.
* Hands-On activities that let us apply lessons and knowledge to our own project was helpful.
* Helpful TA and professor interaction to get quick guidance and feedback

## What could have been better in the class...
* More consistent professor attendance
* Some of the lessons seemed rushed/unprepared. Was confusing sometimes with a lot of the assignments having old information or unprepared templates.

## Further Comments
* Given further time there are aspects we would have liked to improve upon further for our project. These include further testing and debugging, as well as better feature implementation and visual deisgn.
