## Lessons Learned

Priority of things. Understanding the difference in different priorities and benefits from certain things. An example from the guest speaker is prioritizing color of a thing vs priorities on another buisness deal. And how that in the buisness industry there are all kinds of things people may put priorities on.

Scrum. They are a service industry. Not a software selling industry. There are things that comes up out of nowhere. An example of this is when they lost their terminal and they need something done now. Not what was planned for the future or later.
They had swapped to Kanban. Another issue was this, most of the things that they worked on, it was around 90% done. But it is still usuable and still fine. The purpose of Kanban was to keep work moving.
